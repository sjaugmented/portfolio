        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p>
          My life began with storytelling. It was what always interested me.
          This lead me from writing to screenwriting to eventually combining my
          love of story with my love of photography and Mastering in
          Cinematography and working as a professional Cinematographer for over
          a decade.

          Recently I wanted to challenge myself with a new skill set. The world
          runs on software and I’ve always wanted to understand and become
          proficient with the languages that make our modern world go round.
          Covid2020 gave me the perfect opportunity to knuckle down and do just
          that.

          Creative problem solving and team management are the pillars of my
          professional experience. I thrive in high stress environments and
          maintain a calm, relaxed, goal-focused attitude. I bring the same
          level-headed approach to my code and Full Stack development: What is
          the feeling we want to evoke in the user; what are the limiting
          factors of the project; what’s the best way forward? These are the
          central questions that define everything I do.
        </p>

          When I’m not programming or shooting features or commercials, you can
          find me hiking, running, or relaxing with the occasional video game or
          movie.
